The network server for kafka. Now application specific code here, just general network server stuff.
<br>
The classes Receive and Send encapsulate the incoming and outgoing transmission of bytes. A Handler
is a mapping between a Receive and a Send, and represents the users hook to add logic for mapping requests
to actual processing code. Any uncaught exceptions in the reading or writing of the transmissions will result in 
the server logging an error and closing the offending socket. As a result it is the duty of the Handler
implementation to catch and serialize any application-level errors that should be sent to the client.
<br>
This slightly lower-level interface that models sending and receiving rather than requests and responses
is necessary in order to allow the send or receive to be overridden with a non-user-space writing of bytes
using FileChannel.transferTo.


kafka的网络服务器。现在应用程序特定的代码，只是一般网络服务器的东西
Receive和Send类封装了字节的传入和传出传输。Handler是Receive和Send之间的映射，表示用户钩子添加用于将请求映射到实际处理代码的逻辑。在读取或写入传输时，任何未捕获的异常都将导致服务器记录错误并关闭有问题的套接字。因此，Handler实现的任务是捕获并序列化应发送给客户端的任何应用程序级错误。
为了允许使用FileChannel.transferTo以非用户空间写入字节来覆盖发送或接收，这个稍微低级的接口模拟发送和接收而不是请求和响应。
